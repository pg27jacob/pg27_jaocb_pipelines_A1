Random Room Object Generator

Inside The Editor Folder has the tool bar code that runs the generator.

The Scene should be good to go. Open Tools on the tool bar, then select the Random Generator, and press.
It will generate 4 objects. Parameters can be adjusted

If not create a plane, and a empty game object that is as big as the room you want to go over top.

Create another empty object, attach the RandomObjectGenerator from the scripts folder to it,
then attach all the objects inside the script parameters, RoomGenerator, and Plane, then you will also add the object prefab
and how many of them you want generated inside.
